# Tududle

## Project Overview 
A functional TeuxDeux-clone/organiser webapp I'm working on using Vue/Flask/PostreSQL. I wanted to make my own because all the free ones are kinda bad and this is good practice.I can also personalise it a little more than TeuxDeux. 

## Current Progress
Finished the UI with the ability to add/delete/cross-out todo items done. Now working on backend using Flask and PostgreSQL.
